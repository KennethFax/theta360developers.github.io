Build a simple app in minutes. Learn advanced concepts and techniques.

= Building a Simple Video Capture App

In this tutorial you will find out how to build simple funcationality to control the RICOH THETA S 360 degree camera. We will walk through step-by-step connecting to the camera, setting up simple API commands, and building a Python app that can start and stop the video, including setting multiple recording sessions in a row, and deciding how long each video segment will be.

When you're done with this tutorial, you should have a good understanding how to control the camera through the open API, and have a basic example app to work with and customize as needed.

Some simple level programming skills are recommended. But this tutorial not require understanding how to build a program from scratch, just how to read code and edit lightly.

== Before You Begin

Here's a taste of what the SDK offers for controlling the camera.

  ImageData getImage(java.lang.String fileId, HttpDownloadListener listener)
  Acquire raw data of specified image

  ImageSize getImageSize()
  Acquire currently set shooting size

  java.util.ArrayList<ImageInfo> getList()
  Acquire list of media files on device

  private java.util.ArrayList<ImageInfo> getListInternal(int maxReceiveEntry, java.lang.String token)
  Acquire media file list (limited number of items)

  java.io.InputStream getLivePreview()
  Acquire live view stream

  private java.lang.String getState()
  Acquire device status

  StorageInfo getStorageInfo()
  Acquire storage information of device

  Bitmap getThumb(java.lang.String fileId)
  Acquire thumbnail image

Hopefully, at this stage I've enticed you to open up the official SDK and
see if it meets your needs.

The SDK covers display and navigation of media. It does not cover video
streaming.


== Sending Your First Commands
The https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/sdk/[official RICOH SDK] is a
great place to start to understand how to work with 360 degree media.

To help you start your amazing app quickly, we've also started collecting
community information in an unofficial media guide.

== Building a First App
These are ideas brought up by the community. We do not know if they are feasible.
As far as we know, no one has successfully built these applications.

=== Shooting Video In Succession

This concept was submitted by a professional VR photographer, but has not
been built yet. I've adapted the concept with my own idea of using
Raspberry Pi units.

=== Why Python?

Materials:

* 4 Raspberry Pi units. Cheap ones fine. Processing power not important.
* 4 USB WiFi dongles
* 8 wires to connect to the GPIO pins of the Raspberry Pi
* Frame or board to mount the Raspberry Pi units together as a single
transportable unit
* Physical electrical button
* Portable power supply for the Raspberry Pis (battery)

=== Other Ways To Do It

Pointers:

* https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/[Adafruit GPIO Setup Guide for Raspberry Pi]
* https://developers.theta360.com/en/docs/v2/api_reference/options/_wlan_channel.html[`_wlanChannel`] option to set WiFi channel of camera if you encounter interference
* http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/[Unofficial API guide] with Raspberry Pi section and Python code examples


== Next Steps
If you're interested in testing out the API, I suggest you read the
http://codetricity.github.io/theta-s/[Unofficial API Guide]. Have fun!
